This repo contains a compiler and two VMs (one OCaml, and one Javascript) for a new language called MiniML. It has two compilers, an OCaml reference implementation and the MiniML self-hosted version. The self-hosted version is mostly mechanically translated from the OCaml reference compiler using the tools/ocaml_to_mml executable, and can be run with `make translate-all`. The self_host/main.mml file is manually updated. Both compilers share a common MiniML standard library in stdlib/ . You can rebuild the self-host-compile for the parity tests and web by running `make self-host-compile-js`, as the parity runner uses the JS compiler JSON. You can find a lot of useful commands in the Makefile. There's also a web playground and JS virtual machine in the js/ folder. When making changes you should run `make test-ocaml` to validate there are no regressions. When fixing compiler bugs make sure to add comprehensive test cases in the cross_test/ folder. To validate the self host compiler still works you can run `make test-parity`, but note this test suite is much slower than `test-ocaml` so it should be run last or skipped if the change is like to be ported over. When making bytecode or VM changes you can run `make test-js` to test the Javascript VM, as the `make test-ocaml` already uses the OCaml VM. Documentation about the language, like syntax, control structures, type system, and more can be found in the docs/ folder. The research/ folder contains older information and can be ignored unless explicitly requested. Also at the end of implementation summaries include any oddities, quirks, or bugs you had to workaround so they can be logged for later. Note that if statements in MiniML use `do/else/end` instead of `then/else` like ocaml, see the syntax doc for more nuance.
